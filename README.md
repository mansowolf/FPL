# FPL

The purpose of this repository is to assist with connecting to Fantasy Premier League API's using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

The script extracts the player, squad and points for the current season.

A database was created in PostgreSql. The data extracted from the API's is then transformed and loaded into the database.

A next version of the script aims to extract prior seasons points for machine learning studies.
